# go-threejs

Experimental Go binding to ThreeJS using GopherJS.

This is the start of an experiment that gave some initial promising results...
good enough to create some animations using Go. See the examples directory
for an animated robot arm, assembled from STL models downloaded from
Thingiverse.

I have not used it in a couple years, but wanted to make it available
in case anyone wishes to take it to the next level.

This is not an official Google product.
